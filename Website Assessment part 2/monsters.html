            <h2>Rathalos</h2>
            <img src="rathalos.jpeg" alt="Rathalos">
            <p>Rathalos are male Flying Wyverns introduced in Monster Hunter. Having appeared in every single Monster Hunter game in the series, including spin-offs, Rathalos are considered an icon of the Monster Hunter series.</p>
			<p>Rathalos are large, bipedal wyverns with a spiny, armored hide covering their body. It is primarily bright red, with black markings throughout. Rathalos possess a flame sac which is used to produce deadly flaming projectiles from the mouth. The talons upon their feet are highly poisonous and are known to inflict toxic mortal wounds on larger prey. In addition, their long, thick tail features a heavy spiked club at the end.</p>
			<p>Rathalos are expert flyers, and as such are prone to hunting from the skies. By launching a surprise aerial attack, they can inflict poisonous wounds with their talons or burn prey with flaming projectiles. On the ground, Rathalos remain formidable opponents. Using their powerful legs, they can chase down prey from a distance or inflict blunt-force damage with their clubbed tail. At a close enough range, they are known to use their sharp teeth to bite at foes as well.</p>

            <h2>Diablos</h2>
            <img src="diablos.jpeg" alt="Diablos">
            <p>Diablos are large, bipedal wyverns with powerful armor plating covering much of their body. Their most noteworthy feature is a pair of massive, solid bull-like horns above their red eyes. Diablos also possess a pair of tusk-like fangs and a large, spiny neck frill. Their tail ends with a heavy, studded club that can be used to ward off attackers. Diablos stand on a pair of stocky, wide-set legs and possess a broad upper body complete with thick, muscular wings.</p>
			<p>Diablos have the ability to burrow into the earth and travel underground, employing this tactic to surprise unsuspecting targets or slip away from a dangerous encounter. In addition, they are capable of producing a powerful roar that will stun most aggressors. Using their powerful legs in tandem with their heavy upper body and head, Diablos can run at high speeds to charge attackers with their horns, using the powerful momentum to maximize the potential for damage.</p>
			<p>Diablos are herbivores, known to feed on the plentiful cacti of the desert. Despite this however, they are wildly aggressive and extremely territorial, and will pursue anything which enters their territory. Diablos are known to use their horns as weapons against attackers, but will also use them in bouts against other Diablos in battles for territory or mating rights.</p>

            <h2>Nergigante</h2>
			<img src="nergigante.png" alt="Nergigante">
			<p>Nergigante is an Elder Dragon first introduced in Monster Hunter: World.</p>
			<p>Nergigante is a dragon with a bristly appearance. It is covered in spikes that constantly regrow as they're broken off. It has two massive horns similar to a bull. The monster's hide is primarily black with purple and orange accents. Nergigante is constantly regenerating its skin as it attacks and is struck by hunters. It will slowly grow white spikes on certain body parts, which harden over time. Hunters must try to break the white spikes before they harden. Once they have hardened, its attacks deal more damage. These spikes are white in color when they regrow, but will turn black if left to harden. Once these spikes have hardened, they will deal more damage to foes and repel attacks.</p>
			<p>Nergigante is an extremely aggressive monster that will continue to fight even if it means harming its own body, and will only become more ferocious as it is injured and pushed further into a corner. It'll attack anything without hesitation, especially if a creature dares attack it first. Nergigante is particularly ferocious towards other Elder Dragons, actively hunting and feeding on them to gain massive amounts of energy; it has been theorized that Nergigante may even be one of nature's ways of keeping them in check. </p>
